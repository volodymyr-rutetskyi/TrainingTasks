          <p>
            LinguaLive fosters students’ practical application of language
            skills acquired in the classroom by providing a platform for
            learners to engage in structured conversations with native speakers.
            We collaborated with secondary language students and professional
            linguists on this project after observing that language learners
            need a way to practice speaking because the goal of learning a new
            language is to have real-world conversations.
