          <h3>PRODUCT</h3>
          <div class="underline"></div>
          <p>
            LinguaLive fosters students’ practical application of language
            skills acquired in the classroom by providing a platform for
            learners to engage in structured conversations with native speakers.
            We collaborated with secondary language students and professional
            linguists on this project after observing that language learners
            need a way to practice speaking because the goal of learning a new
            language is to have real-world conversations.

            <h3>The problem</h3>
            <p>
              After interviewing several language students, we came up with a
              problem statement that encompasses the key pain point we aimed to
              solve with design thinking.
            </p>
            <p>
              Language learners need a way to practice speaking because the goal
              of learning a new language is to be ablt to have real-world
              conversations.
